### Project Overview
<br>
The Customer Churn Analysis aims to analyze customer churn behavior in a telecom company using a blend of SQL Server, Python, and Power BI. The goal is to identify key factors influencing churn, build a predictive machine learning model, and present actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

### Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about customers, their services, account details, and churn status. Below is a summary of the key features:

**Recent Customer Churn**: Indicates whether the customer has discontinued the service within the last month (captured in the Churn column).

**Subscribed Services**: Shows which services each customer is subscribed to, including phone service, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, technical support, and streaming services (TV and movies).

**Account Information**: Covers customer tenure, type of contract, preferred payment method, use of paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges to date.

**Demographic Details**: Includes attributes such as gender, age range, and whether the customer has a partner or dependents.
